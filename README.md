# Stride Quest — Expo React Native Skeleton

A simple Expo React Native scaffold with a Solo Leveling–inspired dark/neon theme and five core screens: Home, Activities, Leaderboard, Quest, Profile.

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install Expo CLI globally if you don't have it:

```powershell
npm install -g expo-cli
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\lamig\Stride Quest"; npm install
```

3. Start the app and open in Expo Go on your phone or emulator:

```powershell
npm start
```

Notes:
- This is a minimal scaffold. Replace placeholder assets in `assets/` and extend logic for real fitness tracking, auth, and persistent storage.
- Recommended next steps: integrate Expo Location/Permissions, add Redux or Context for state, wire real activity data, and refine UI assets.
